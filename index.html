            <p>A small tool created by @stevensoyuz to help us become faster sorters.</p>

            <h3>What is this for?</h3>
            <p>This is a small web application I developed in 2024 after feeling silly about just how long it took me to catalogue things alphabetically. It's been a great help to me, and I figured it might be useful for others preparing for positions at their local library, or just wanted to become faster sorters.</p>
